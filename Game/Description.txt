An simple realization of knock_a_mole game, did not include public scoreboard as well as other notification of the operations yet.

# key design:
# 20 sec time slot
# each mole appear between [1,4] sec
# each mole appear at least once during time slot
# 

Just play by yourself!
pls install java to run the application

# future improvement:
# add on public scoreboard
# use more vivid feature patterns representing hiting operation
# consider other randomize algorithms

Any hidden bug issue pls contact
